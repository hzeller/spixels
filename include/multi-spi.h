// of data.
// Also, there is no chip-select at this point (not needed for the LED strips).

//     use a time-component for triggering (WS2801).
// Parameter:
//   "speed_mhz" rough speed in Mhz of the SPI clock. Useful values 1..15
//   Default is 4. Increase if your set-up can do more and you need the
//   speed. Decrease if you see erratic behavior.

// Advantages:
//   - Does not use CPU
//   - Jitter does not exceed several 10 usec. Needed for WS2801.
// Disadvantage:
//   - Limited speed (1-2Mhz). Good for WS2801 which can't go faster
//     anyway, but wasting potential with LPD6803 or APA102 that can go
//     much faster.
